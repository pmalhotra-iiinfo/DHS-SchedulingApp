Feature: Requestor persona (or role)
  As a Requestor, I shall be presented if I attempted to book same conference rooms at the same time.
  (Detect scheduling conflict.) The intent is to detect scheduling conflicts and prevent the same conference room from being double booked.
  Unavailable rooms should not be offered/presented to Requestor for selection
